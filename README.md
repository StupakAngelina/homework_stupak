1. In the epamTests project created 7 successful tests out of 8.
2. In the last test, the .hover () method does not have time to work out clickOnButtonLAboutTab
3. Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
   actions.moveToElement(aboutTab).build().perform();
4. I used MacOS and Intellij Idea
5. Also required for work Automation API WebDriver and Testing Framework NUnit
6. To run the tests you only need to go to Intellij Idea, open the epamTests project and start it by clicking "Run"
